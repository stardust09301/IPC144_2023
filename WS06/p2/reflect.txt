1. Why are there three types of iteration constructs if we can make any one of them behave the same way? Refer
to your code in this workshop to help backup your answer (do NOT include the code in your answer). Typically,
when working with arrays, there is one iteration construct we favour â€“ what is it and explain why it is more 
preferred over the other options.
	
	There are while loop, do while and for loops. For loops is very convenient when you know the iteration,
condition, and it is usually great for increment and decrement. It is still confusing to me but it is only one line 
and simple. The while loop is simple conditional loop that it checks the condition to see if the loop should be keep going.
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it can execute the code at least once and check the condition. 
It is useful when we need to print the code at least once so I prefer it the most. In my code, I use do while for
 user input income and printing out error messages while valid ==0. Similarly, I use do while for financing and priority
option to print out errors. When we are getting the items and details iterated,I used for loops to list out all the items
and let the items incremented itself.
	


2. Describe what you did to both test and debug your program. How did you go about finding where the 
problems were located (explain how you did this for both syntactic and semantic problems)?

	 First, while I am writing the code, I look at red curly lines to see it there are some errors showing up. And then, 
I build the solution and run the code without debugging, if there are errors, I see them in the error lists quickly. 
In the error lists, errors can be spotted and searchable by lines. I checked what lines are showing the errors and
try to fix the problem. If there are syntax errors, the visual studio usually gives me errors so it is easily spotted.
But I also need to double check to see if there are sematic problems like logical errors or calculation errors because
they are not easily spotted. I tried to run without debugging for quickly running the program for easy fix. 
However, I run the debugging sometimes if there are persistent errors since it can provide breakpoints line by line
to look for problems.

3. When attempting to submit your work, you receive the following error feedback from the submitter:
Checking output:
In line number 6 of your output:
The output should be:
Enter your monthly NET income: $0
 ^
But your output is:
Enter your monthly NET income: $567.89
 ^
Unmatched character details:
The character in column 33 is supposed to be:
 [0] ASCII code(48)
but you printed
 [5] ASCII code(53)
Outputs don't match. Submission aborted!
To see exactly what is wrong, open the following two files in this
directory and compare them:
Your output file: output.txt
Correct output file: w6p2_master_output.txt
Using the above explicit information, explain each step you must take to successfully identify and fix your error.

	I check the output.txt and check to see which line has the problem. Since there is user input error in my output, 
I will try to check the information and re-enter the information. When error occurs, there are master_output.txt, 
output.txt and differ.txt created in the Seneca matrix server, so I would double-check my output.txt with 
master_output.txt. I will also double check my code if there are next possible errors since submitter only catches
one error at a time.
